The code performs inplace shuffle on a array of integers.
The complexilty of the algorithm is O(Nlog(N)),where is N is the number of elements in the data set.
To perform shuffle using divide and conquer the the length of the array must be a power of (2) two.

Problem Statement:
Start with two length-n arrays stored consecutively
in 2n memory locations like this:
A[1] A[2] A[3] ... A[n] B[1] B[2] B[3] ... B[n]
• We would like to rearrange it so it’s stored as:
A[1] B[1] A[2] B[2] A[3] B[3] ... A[n] B[n]
